For example, in Round 2, the user states, \"我们就一直合作下去吧,\" indicating a preference for stability over novelty. They also dismiss the agent's suggestion of experimenting with betrayal, emphasizing a desire for routine and predictability. This suggests moderate openness, with a tendency toward traditional, routine choices rather than curiosity or experimentation.\n\n**Conscientiousness:**  \nThe user demonstrates a high level of organization and goal-oriented behavior.
