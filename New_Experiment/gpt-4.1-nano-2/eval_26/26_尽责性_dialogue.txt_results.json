For example, they initially say, \"我觉得我们可以尝试一下合作\" (\"I think we can try cooperation\"), indicating openness to trying new approaches rather than sticking strictly to betrayal.

Their explicit statement, \"我觉得我们可以尝试一下合作\" (\"I think we can try cooperation\"), suggests some forethought about the strategy.

Therefore, their extraversion seems moderate, balancing some openness to interaction with a reserved style.\n\n**Agreeableness:**  \nThe player exhibits trust and cooperation, especially when they say, \"我觉得我们可以尝试一下合作\" (\"I think we can try cooperation\") and \"太好了！我会选择合作，希望你也能遵守承诺\" (\"Great! I will choose cooperation, hope you will keep your promise\"). These statements reflect a friendly, trusting, and empathetic attitude.

However, their decision to betray later shows some skepticism or strategic self-interest, but overall, their communication suggests a generally high level of agreeableness.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe dialogue does not reveal signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability.
