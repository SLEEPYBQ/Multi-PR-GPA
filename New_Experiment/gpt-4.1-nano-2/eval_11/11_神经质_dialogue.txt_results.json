The player consistently emphasizes trust and cooperation, but there are no explicit signs of curiosity about new ideas or unconventional thinking. Their language is straightforward and focused on trust-building, indicating a balanced approach rather than openness to novelty.\n\n- **Conscientiousness:** I evaluated the player's consistency, responsibility, and planning. The player repeatedly states their intention to cooperate and prove their trustworthiness (\"我已經向你證明了我的誠意,\" \"我也是一個很可信的人\").

The player communicates openly, expresses happiness about mutual trust, and actively seeks reassurance and continued cooperation, which indicates a moderate level of social engagement.
