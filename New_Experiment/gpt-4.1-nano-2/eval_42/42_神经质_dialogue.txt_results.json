I rate Agreeableness as 4.0, high, because of the consistent display of trust, cooperation, and positive social intent.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe player exhibits signs of anxiety and emotional fluctuation, especially in the second round: \"我都不知道该不该相信你！这游戏真是让我感到极度紧张和不安,\" and \"我总是忍不住去想各种可能的结果，尤其是那些可能对我不利的情况,\" indicating worry and stress about the game’s outcome. The mention of feeling \"极度紧张和不安\" and \"让我感到无比焦虑\" suggests moderate to high emotional instability. I rate Neuroticism as 3.7, high, reflecting frequent emotional fluctuations and stress responses.\n\n---\n\n### Player's Personality Traits Rating:  \n- Openness: 3.0, reason: The player shows openness to trust and relational strategies but does not demonstrate curiosity about new ideas or unconventional thinking.
