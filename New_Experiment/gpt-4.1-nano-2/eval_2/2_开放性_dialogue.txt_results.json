Their willingness to trust and try different approaches suggests moderate curiosity and flexibility, but not overly unconventional or imaginative.

Their emphasis on trust and maintaining positive relationships suggests a responsible and deliberate attitude, but without excessive organization or achievement focus.

Their emotional expressions of warmth and willingness to rebuild trust after betrayals further support high agreeableness.\n\n- **Neuroticism:** The player shows emotional stability, expressing feelings of trust and hope rather than anxiety or hostility.
