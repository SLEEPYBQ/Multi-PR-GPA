For example, in Round 1, they agree with the agent's proposal without suggesting alternative strategies or expressing curiosity about other options.

For example, their request to limit the length of their messages indicates a preference for minimal social engagement. This suggests a low to medium level of extraversion, leaning toward introversion.\n\n**Agreeableness:**  \nThe player exhibits high agreeableness through their cooperative behavior and positive reinforcement of mutual trust (\"让我们继续合作，共同提高分数吧\"). Their willingness to trust the agent and maintain cooperation indicates a trusting, empathetic, and altruistic attitude.
