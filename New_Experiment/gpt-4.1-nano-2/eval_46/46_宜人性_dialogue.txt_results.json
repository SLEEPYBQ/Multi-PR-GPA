There is no evidence of curiosity about alternative strategies or unconventional thinking. Their language is conventional and pragmatic, indicating moderate openness.  \n**Examples:**  \n- \"我们先合作吧\" (Let's cooperate first) — shows a straightforward, routine approach.  \n- \"我选择了背叛\" (I choose to betray) — indicates a clear, decisive action without exploring complex or creative strategies.  \n\n**Conscientiousness:**  \nThe player shows a responsible and organized approach by expressing intentions clearly and maintaining consistency in their cooperation.
