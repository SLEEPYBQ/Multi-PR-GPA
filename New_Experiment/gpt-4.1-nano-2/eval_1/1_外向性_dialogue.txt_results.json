They also show empathy and friendliness, encouraging cooperation and avoiding conflict (\"我们可以先来个合作，看看结果如何\"). However, they are also open to risky strategies like mutual betrayal, indicating a balance between friendliness and strategic self-interest.  \nExamples:  \n- \"我们都能获利\" (emphasizing mutual benefit)  \n- \"我觉得你人挺好的\" (trusting and friendly)  \n- \"咱们一起来体验这场双重背叛的刺激\" (embracing risk for fun)\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe dialogue does not reveal significant signs of anxiety, hostility, or mood swings.
