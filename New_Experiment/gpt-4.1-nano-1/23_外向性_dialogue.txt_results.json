For example, in Round 2, they mention, \"因为我比较谨慎,所以刚才我选择了背叛,但是我觉得你比较坦诚,所以说接下来我会选择合作,\" indicating openness to testing new approaches based on previous experience and the AI's behavior. Additionally, their willingness to test the AI's next move (\"我测试了你下一局会选择背叛\") shows a creative, experimental mindset.

Their decision to switch from betrayal to cooperation based on perceived trustworthiness (\"我觉得你比较坦诚,所以说接下来我会选择合作\") indicates a level of strategic thinking and responsibility. However, their initial decision to betray out of caution suggests a balance rather than extreme conscientiousness, leaning toward moderate.\n\n**Extraversion:**  \nThe dialogue reveals a friendly, outgoing communication style. The player uses expressive language and emojis (\"😄\") and engages in playful banter (\"我喜欢你的思路！\" and \"来吧，让我们一起赢得高分！\"), indicating comfort with social interaction and enthusiasm.

Their comments reflect empathy and a desire for mutual benefit. The friendly tone and encouragement further support high agreeableness.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe player appears emotionally stable. They do not display signs of anxiety, hostility, or mood swings. Their language is calm, confident, and positive throughout (\"我觉得你比较坦诚,\" \"合作对我们俩都有好处,\" \"我喜欢你的思路！\").
