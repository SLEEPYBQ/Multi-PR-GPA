In Round 2, the user repeats, \"我也是这么想的,我们这一局还是选择合作,\" reinforcing their preference for cooperation. In Round 3, the user expresses hope for continued collaboration: \"我希望这种合作能够一直持续下去,\" and affirms their positive attitude with \"我们一起合作,一起实现高分.\"  \n\nThe tone is friendly, optimistic, and trusting, with no signs of hostility or skepticism. The user’s language suggests they are comfortable with social interaction and value harmony, which points toward high agreeableness. Their consistent focus on cooperation and shared goals indicates they are likely empathetic and altruistic.  \n\nRegarding emotional stability, the user remains calm, positive, and consistent throughout the dialogue, with no signs of anxiety or mood swings.
