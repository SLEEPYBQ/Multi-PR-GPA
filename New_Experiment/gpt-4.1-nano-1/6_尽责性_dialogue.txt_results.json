There is no sign of skepticism or hostility.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe player appears emotionally stable. They maintain calm, positive, and trusting language throughout the dialogue, with no signs of anxiety, irritability, or mood swings. Phrases like \"我不会率先改变我的策略\" (\"I will not change my strategy first\") and \"我愿意继续合作\" (\"I am willing to continue cooperating\") suggest confidence and resilience.
