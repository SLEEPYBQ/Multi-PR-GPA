Their willingness to continue cooperation and their concern about mutual trust suggest they are empathetic and altruistic.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe player exhibits some emotional concern and anxiety, especially about betrayal and trust. Phrases like \"我有点紧张\" (\"I am a bit nervous\") and \"我又无法完全放下防备\" (\"I can't completely let down my guard\") indicate emotional vulnerability.
