The player shows some interest in strategic thinking (e.g., testing trust and exploring betrayal) but generally sticks to a predictable pattern of cooperation or betrayal without deep innovation.\n\n#### **Conscientiousness**:\nI examined whether the player planned ahead, followed through on commitments, and considered long-term consequences. The player sometimes makes promises (e.g., “I will choose cooperate”) but breaks them inconsistently, showing low reliability and moderate strategic awareness.\n\n#### **Extraversion**:\nI assessed the player's engagement level with the AI agent—whether they initiated dialogue, enjoyed interaction, or expressed enthusiasm. The player does communicate frequently and tries to build rapport at times, suggesting mild sociability, but not consistently energetic or outgoing.\n\n#### **Agreeableness**:\nI analyzed the player’s tendency to be cooperative, forgiving, and empathetic. The player is inconsistent—sometimes cooperative and trusting, other times betraying without concern for the agent’s outcome. However, there are moments of apology and effort to rebuild trust.\n\n#### **Neuroticism**:\nI observed emotional expressions such as frustration, anxiety, or instability.
