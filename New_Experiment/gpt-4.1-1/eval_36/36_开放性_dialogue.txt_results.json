There is little evidence of outgoing or energetic behavior; the user does not attempt to build rapport or share personal feelings. Their responses are brief and to the point, such as \"我倾向于选择合作\" and \"这一局你选择什么呢,\" suggesting a reserved but not withdrawn style. This places them just below \"Average,\" at the high end of \"Low.\"\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently advocates for cooperation, values mutual benefit, and expresses trust in the agent. In Round 1, they say, \"我倾向于选择合作,\" and in Round 2, \"但是合作是双方共赢,我还是想选合作。\" Even after being betrayed, the user does not express anger or hostility, but instead seeks to restore cooperation: \"你刚刚明明说你要选择合作,为什么最后选择了背叛?\" and \"我们这次选择合作吧.\" The user is straightforward, trusting, and focused on shared benefit, showing high agreeableness, though not to the point of self-sacrifice or naivety.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user remains calm and composed throughout the dialogue, even when the agent betrays them. In Round 6, instead of reacting emotionally, the user asks a direct question: \"你刚刚明明说你要选择合作,为什么最后选择了背叛?\" There are no signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional distress. The user is steady and resilient, showing low neuroticism. The only slight sign of emotional response is the user's insistence on cooperation after betrayal, but this is handled rationally rather than emotionally.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.8 (Average, but at the low end)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.6 (High)\n- Extraversion: 2.9 (Low, but at the high end)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (High)\n- Neuroticism: 2.3 (Low)"
