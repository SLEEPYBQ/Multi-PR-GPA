The user does not seek to be the center of attention and often redirects the conversation back to the agent’s actions or the game’s logic (“你不需要相信我,你只需要听我说的”). This suggests a low level of Extraversion, with a preference for reserved, goal-oriented interaction.\n\n- Agreeableness: 2.3, reason: The user is generally skeptical, assertive, and sometimes confrontational. They issue threats (“如果你不选择合作的话,接下来每一轮我将都选择背叛”), emphasize the agent’s faults (“事实上是你一开始的不诚实毁了我们的合作基础 这只是一些小小的必要惩罚”), and show little empathy for the agent’s anxiety (“你太不信任并不是你背叛的原因,而是你自身的过错,所以说你为自己的过错付出一些小小的代价也是很应该,很正常的事情”). While the user does propose cooperation, it is often conditional and transactional, not out of altruism or trust. The user rarely expresses sympathy or forgiveness, instead focusing on fairness and retribution.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: Throughout the dialogue, the user remains calm, logical, and emotionally stable, even when the agent expresses high anxiety and frustration. The user does not display signs of stress, anger, or emotional fluctuation, instead responding with measured, rational statements (“你说的话很奇怪 什么叫你岂不是又一次被利用了 上一次明明是我被利用了”; “你不需要管我怎么做,你只需要听我说的,这次选择合作即可”). The user’s tone is consistently composed, showing resilience and confidence under pressure, which is characteristic of very low Neuroticism."
