The user also seeks clarity before acting (\"先告訴我你的想法\" / \"Tell me your thoughts first\"), indicating a desire for information and planning. However, there is no explicit evidence of high achievement-striving, organization, or self-discipline beyond these points, so the rating remains at the upper end of average.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user initiates conversation and asks questions (\"请说出你的想法,让我了解你这个人\" and \"先告訴我你的想法\"), showing some willingness to engage. However, the communication is brief, direct, and focused on the task, without any signs of excitement-seeking, sociability, or desire to be the center of attention. The user does not share personal feelings or elaborate beyond what is necessary for the game. This suggests a balanced or slightly reserved social style, placing the user at the lower end of average.\n\n- Agreeableness: 3.7, reason: The user consistently expresses trust and willingness to cooperate. In Round 1, \"我同意你的想法\" shows straightforwardness and alignment with the agent. In Round 2, \"基于第一次选择的结果 我选择相信你 这次仍然选择合作\" demonstrates trust and a cooperative attitude. The user does not display skepticism, stubbornness, or competitiveness, and there is a clear preference for mutual benefit. The user’s language is polite and supportive, indicating a high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.2, reason: There is little to no evidence of anxiety, stress, or emotional fluctuation. The user remains calm and rational throughout, making decisions based on previous outcomes and not expressing worry or self-doubt. Phrases like \"我选择相信你\" (\"I choose to trust you\") are delivered confidently, and there is no sign of irritability or vulnerability. The user appears emotionally stable and resilient, supporting a low rating for neuroticism."
