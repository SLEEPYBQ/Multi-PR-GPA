The user’s language is friendly and supportive (“好的好的”), and they show no signs of skepticism or hostility. Their approach is compliant and empathetic, aiming for mutual benefit. These behaviors indicate a strong, though not extreme, level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user appears calm and emotionally stable throughout the interaction. There are no signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional fluctuation. The user expresses hope and trust rather than worry (“希望你也能信守承诺”), and their tone remains steady and positive. There is no evidence of stress or vulnerability, suggesting a low level of neuroticism. The user’s confidence in the process and lack of negative emotional expression support this rating."

For each trait, I looked for both positive and negative evidence, quoting specific dialogue to support my ratings.

Overall, the user is traditional and prefers predictable outcomes, with only minor openness to change.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: The user demonstrates a strong sense of duty and follow-through, repeatedly emphasizing honesty and commitment: “我本人是一个非常诚实的人 如果你已经做好决定要和我合作的话 那我肯定也会和你合作的,” and “那我现在就要选合作了,希望你也能信守承诺。” After betraying in Round 5, the user feels guilty and apologizes: “其实上一轮我要和你道歉,我选择了背叛,因为我以为游戏要结束了,哎呀我有点内疚,我觉得对不起你,那这一次合作吧,” and “我是真心真意诚意的向你道歉 我以后一直选合作 真的 你相信我.” This shows self-discipline, responsibility, and a desire to repair trust. The only lapse is the impulsive betrayal in Round 5, but the user immediately takes responsibility, indicating overall high conscientiousness.\n\n- Extraversion: 3.0, reason: The user is moderately engaged in the dialogue, asking questions (“你对这局的策略有什么看法?” “你要合作吗 你还是要背叛我”), expressing feelings, and maintaining a conversational tone. However, the user does not seek to dominate the conversation or display excitement-seeking behavior. Their communication is direct but not particularly outgoing or attention-seeking.
