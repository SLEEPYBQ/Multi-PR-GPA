The user agrees to the agent's suggestions and maintains a polite, straightforward tone throughout. There is no evidence of hostility or stubbornness, and the user is generally compliant and empathetic to the idea of mutual gain, indicating a moderately high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.2, reason: The user remains calm and composed throughout the dialogue. There are no signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional fluctuation. Even when discussing the possibility of betrayal, the user states their position matter-of-factly without emotional escalation: \"如果你选择背叛的话 接下来每一轮你都得不到分数.\" The user does not express worry or stress about the game's outcome and maintains a steady, confident tone. This suggests a low level of neuroticism, indicating emotional stability and resilience."
