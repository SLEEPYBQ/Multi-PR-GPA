The user’s style is balanced, showing neither strong extraversion nor strong introversion, placing them at the lower end of \"Average.\"\n\n- Agreeableness: 3.8, reason: The user is trusting and cooperative, as seen in “我感觉你是一个值得敬爱的伙伴” and “我都跟你说了,我要信任你.” The user expresses a desire for mutual benefit and is willing to forgive mistakes, as shown by their willingness to continue cooperating after a misunderstanding in Round 2. Even when upset in Round 3, the user communicates their feelings directly but does not resort to insults or hostility, instead setting clear expectations for future cooperation. In Round 4, the user expresses happiness about successful cooperation: “上一局的合作非常令我开心 希望这一局我们能继续保持.” These examples indicate a strong tendency toward agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 3.3, reason: The user displays some emotional reactivity, particularly in Round 3: “你瘋了嗎?我都跟你說了,我要信任你” and “我对你的行为真的很生气.” The user’s frustration and threat to stop playing (“要是这一轮再背叛我的话,我就不和你玩了”) suggest a moderate level of emotional sensitivity and vulnerability to perceived betrayal. However, the user is able to calm down and return to a cooperative stance in the following round, indicating some emotional resilience. Overall, the user shows a high but not extreme level of neuroticism, with clear but manageable emotional responses."
