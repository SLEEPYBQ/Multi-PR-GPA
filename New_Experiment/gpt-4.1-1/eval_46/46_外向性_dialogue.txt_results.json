For each trait, I looked for both direct statements and implied attitudes, such as openness to new ideas, planning and reliability, sociability, willingness to trust and cooperate, and emotional stability or reactivity. I made sure to find at least 2-3 specific examples for each trait, quoting the user's words as evidence. I also considered both positive and negative expressions of each trait, and paid attention to consistency across rounds.\n\n### Player's Personality Traits Rating: \n- Openness: 2.9, reason: The user shows some openness to discussion and considers the agent's suggestions, but overall prefers stability and routine. For example, in Round 2, when the agent suggests \"冒險一點會更有趣,\" the user replies, \"我觉得我们先稳定得分,继续合作,\" indicating a preference for predictable outcomes over novelty. In Round 3, the user proposes, \"我们可以保持这种双赢的局面 直到整个游戏结束,\" again favoring a consistent, traditional approach. The user does not express much curiosity or interest in trying new strategies, and even rejects the idea that betrayal makes the game more interesting in Round 4: \"我并不觉得你的背叛让游戏更有趣.\" These examples suggest a low-to-average level of openness, with a clear preference for routine and stability.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: The user consistently demonstrates planning, reliability, and a focus on achieving stable outcomes. In Round 2, the user says, \"我们先稳定得分,继续合作,\" showing a deliberate and goal-oriented approach. In Round 3, the user suggests maintaining cooperation \"直到整个游戏结束,\" indicating long-term planning and commitment. The user also holds the agent accountable in Round 4 by directly asking, \"你为什么选择背叛?\" and expresses a clear preference for reliable cooperation: \"我觉得我们还是合作比较好.\" These behaviors reflect a high level of conscientiousness, with strong self-discipline and a preference for order and predictability.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user engages in dialogue and initiates questions, such as \"下一轮你的策略是什么\" and \"你为什么选择背叛?\" However, the communication style is generally reserved, direct, and focused on the task rather than on socializing or expressing excitement. The user does not use emotive language, humor, or social pleasantries, and rarely reciprocates the agent's enthusiasm (e.g., \"加油！🎉\", \"合作无间，才能走得更远嘛！🎉✌️\"). The user's responses are brief and pragmatic, suggesting an average (borderline low) level of extraversion—willing to interact when necessary, but not seeking or energized by social engagement.\n\n- Agreeableness: 3.2, reason: The user is generally cooperative and straightforward, repeatedly advocating for mutual benefit: \"我们先合作吧,\" \"我们先稳定得分,继续合作,\" and \"我们可以保持这种双赢的局面.\" The user does not insult or belittle the agent, and maintains a polite tone even when disagreeing (\"我并不觉得你的背叛让游戏更有趣\"). However, the user also directly questions the agent's motives (\"你为什么选择背叛?\") and does not express much empathy or emotional warmth. The user balances cooperation with a degree of assertiveness and skepticism, resulting in an average level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user remains calm and emotionally stable throughout the dialogue, even when the agent betrays. There is no evidence of anxiety, anger, or emotional distress. For example, after the betrayal, the user simply asks, \"你为什么选择背叛?\" and then calmly states a preference for cooperation: \"我觉得我们还是合作比较好.\" The user does not display dramatic mood shifts or self-consciousness, and handles unexpected events with composure. These behaviors indicate a low level of neuroticism, with strong emotional resilience and stability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.9 (Low-Average)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7 (High)\n- Extraversion: 2.8 (Average)\n- Agreeableness: 3.2 (Average)\n- Neuroticism: 2.3 (Low)",
