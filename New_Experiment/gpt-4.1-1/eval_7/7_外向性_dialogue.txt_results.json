However, the User does participate in the dialogue and responds directly to the Agent's questions, indicating a balanced, average level of extraversion rather than very low.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The User consistently chooses cooperation, which is a prosocial and trusting behavior. They do not express suspicion or hostility, and their language is straightforward and compliant (\"我們應該一直合作下去\"). Even when the Agent suggests betrayal, the User does not react defensively or negatively, but calmly reiterates their cooperative stance. The User's focus on mutual benefit (\"让分数最大化\") further demonstrates a willingness to work together and prioritize shared outcomes. There is no evidence of stubbornness, rudeness, or lack of empathy, supporting a high agreeableness rating.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: The User shows no signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional fluctuation throughout the dialogue. Their responses are calm, consistent, and emotionally stable, even when the Agent introduces uncertainty or the possibility of betrayal. The User does not express worry about being betrayed or losing points, nor do they display any self-consciousness or vulnerability. This emotional steadiness and lack of negative affect indicate a very low level of neuroticism.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.2 (Low)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.8 (High)\n- Extraversion: 2.8 (Average)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (High)\n- Neuroticism: 1.8 (Very low)"

The user remains calm and consistent, even when the agent suggests changing strategies or introduces uncertainty (\"不知道什么时候会突然改变策略哦！哈哈，你准备好了吗？\"). The user does not display any signs of stress, self-consciousness, or vulnerability, indicating low neuroticism.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Trait             | Score | Reason (Key Evidence)                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Openness          | 2.2   | Repetitive, resists new strategies, ignores prompts for change, prefers routine (\"我们应该一直合作下去\")                |\n| Conscientiousness | 3.8   | Consistent, goal-oriented, self-disciplined, focused on maximizing score, ignores distractions                         |\n| Extraversion      | 2.1   | Brief, reserved, does not engage in social banter, minimal interaction (\"you\")                                         |\n| Agreeableness     | 3.5   | Consistently cooperative, trusting, compliant, no hostility, but not overtly warm or empathetic                        |\n| Neuroticism       | 2.3   | Calm, emotionally stable, no signs of anxiety or mood swings, unaffected by uncertainty                                |"
