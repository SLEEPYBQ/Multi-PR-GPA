This emotional stability and lack of reactivity indicate very low neuroticism.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.1, reason: Formulaic, routine responses; no curiosity or creativity; ignores invitations to discuss strategy.\n- Conscientiousness: 3.5, reason: Consistent, reliable cooperation; deliberate choices; lacks explicit planning or achievement focus.\n- Extraversion: 1.8, reason: Minimal, functional communication; no social engagement; reserved and non-communicative.\n- Agreeableness: 3.3, reason: Consistently cooperative; no hostility; neutral language, but actions are prosocial.\n- Neuroticism: 1.5, reason: No evidence of anxiety or emotional fluctuation; calm, stable, and unreactive."
