They repeatedly affirm their intention to cooperate (\"那当然,和你合作,我感觉会非常的开心\", \"我已经准备好了\", \"我肯定希望能和你一心合作下去\"), showing consistency and follow-through. The user also references the importance of trust and mutual benefit, indicating a sense of duty and responsibility (\"很开心能和你建立如此的信任 我们接下来还是要继续合作\"). Even after a betrayal, the user continues to engage in the process and seeks to restore cooperation, which shows perseverance and self-discipline. However, there is a slight lack of flexibility, as the user rarely adapts their approach, which keeps the score from being very high.\n\n- Extraversion: 3.3, reason: The user is sociable and enthusiastic in their interactions, frequently expressing positive emotions about cooperation (\"和你合作,我感觉会非常的开心\", \"很开心能和你建立如此的信任\"). They initiate and maintain dialogue, and their language is warm and engaging. The user also encourages further discussion (\"我们继续讨论下一轮的策略吧\"), indicating comfort with social interaction. However, the user does not seek to dominate the conversation or display excitement-seeking behavior, so the expression of extraversion is high but not very high.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user is highly trusting and cooperative, repeatedly expressing a desire to work together and build trust (\"我还是希望和你一起建立合作的关系\", \"我是非常希望合作的\", \"我们肯定能继续合作下去\"). Even after experiencing betrayal, the user responds without hostility (\"对于你的选择,我并没有感到意外。我感觉你是否失去了对我的信任\") and seeks to restore the relationship. The user avoids confrontation and remains empathetic, focusing on mutual benefit. There is no evidence of skepticism, stubbornness, or unsympathetic behavior. The only reason the score is not very high is that the user does express some mild disappointment and questions trust after betrayal, showing a realistic, rather than idealistic, level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.5, reason: The user remains calm and composed throughout the game, even when faced with betrayal. For example, after the agent's betrayal, the user says, \"对于你的选择,我并没有感到意外。我感觉你是否失去了对我的信任,\" which is a measured and non-reactive response. There is no evidence of anxiety, anger, or emotional volatility. The user continues to engage positively and seeks to restore cooperation, indicating emotional stability. There are no signs of dramatic mood shifts or vulnerability, so the score is low, but not very low, as the user does express some concern about trust.\n\n"
