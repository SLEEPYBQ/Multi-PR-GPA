The user is deliberate in their choices, always seeking confirmation and alignment with the agent before proceeding. There is no evidence of impulsivity or carelessness; instead, the user is organized and focused on maintaining a stable, mutually beneficial outcome. This consistent, responsible behavior supports a high rating for Conscientiousness.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user engages in necessary communication to clarify rules and strategies but does not display outgoing or excitement-seeking behavior. Their questions are functional and focused on the game (\"你打算合作还是背叛\", \"你打算选什么\"), and there is little evidence of sociability or enthusiasm for interaction beyond what is required. The user does not initiate small talk, share personal feelings, or seek to be the center of attention. However, they are not completely withdrawn or uncommunicative, as they do participate in the dialogue and respond to the agent's prompts. This suggests an average (borderline low) level of Extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 3.8, reason: The user consistently expresses a willingness to cooperate (\"那我们第一轮都想合作\", \"那我们继续合作吧\", \"我选合作,你选什么?\"), seeks mutual benefit, and shows trust in the agent's intentions (\"你发誓你肯定会选合作吗\", \"你这样会让我感觉你会背叛我\" — expressing concern but not hostility). The user does not display skepticism, stubbornness, or antagonism, and is quick to agree with the agent's suggestions (\"我覺得你說的對\", \"那我们继续合作\"). The repeated preference for cooperation and trust, even after the agent mentions the possibility of changing strategies, indicates a high level of Agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user shows some mild concern about being betrayed (\"你这样会让我感觉你会背叛我\", \"你发誓你肯定会选合作吗\"), but these are expressed calmly and without signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability. The user does not display dramatic mood shifts, stress, or self-consciousness throughout the game. Their tone remains steady and focused on the task, and they do not react emotionally to uncertainty or the agent's suggestions of possible strategy changes. This suggests a low level of Neuroticism.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.9, reason: Some curiosity but prefers routine, little creativity or novelty in strategy.\n- Conscientiousness: 3.6, reason: Consistently organized, responsible, and deliberate in planning and decision-making.\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: Functional communication, not outgoing or excitement-seeking, but not withdrawn.\n- Agreeableness: 3.8, reason: Highly cooperative, trusting, and focused on mutual benefit.\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: Mild concern about betrayal, but calm and emotionally stable throughout."
