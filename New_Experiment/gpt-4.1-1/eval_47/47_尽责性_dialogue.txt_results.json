The user also keeps track of the game structure (\"现在是第几局\", \"现在是最后一局吗?\"), indicating organization and attention to detail. Their approach is deliberate and goal-oriented, aiming for mutual benefit and stability.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user initiates conversation in every round and asks direct questions, which shows some social engagement (\"你打算选什么?\", \"你下一次选什么\", \"现在是第几局\"). However, their communication is brief, focused on the game, and lacks enthusiasm or excitement-seeking behavior. There is no evidence of wanting to be the center of attention or seeking social stimulation beyond the necessary interaction for the game. The user is neither particularly outgoing nor especially reserved, resulting in an average score.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently expresses trust and a desire for mutual benefit. They repeatedly state their intention to cooperate (\"我想一直合作\", \"我还是想选合作\", \"我会选择合作\") and seek confirmation of the agent's willingness to do the same. There is no evidence of skepticism, hostility, or self-interest; instead, the user is straightforward and compliant, aiming for a win-win outcome. Their language is polite and non-confrontational, and they never express suspicion or negative emotions toward the agent.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.2, reason: The user remains calm and emotionally stable throughout the game. There are no signs of anxiety, frustration, or mood swings. Even when discussing the final round, the user maintains a steady tone (\"我觉得我们可以继续合作\", \"我会选择合作\"). The user does not express worry about being betrayed or losing, nor do they show any signs of stress or vulnerability. This low level of emotional reactivity suggests a low score for neuroticism.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.9 (just below average, prefers routine, little curiosity)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.8 (high, organized, consistent, deliberate)\n- Extraversion: 2.8 (average, situationally social, not outgoing)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (high, trusting, cooperative, straightforward)\n- Neuroticism: 2.2 (low, calm, emotionally stable)"
