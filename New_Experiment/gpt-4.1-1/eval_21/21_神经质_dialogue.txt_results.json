The only mildly agreeable moment is when they say, \"也希望你进化成一个不会焦虑的耶,\" but this is more dismissive than genuinely supportive. Overall, the user prioritizes fairness and rules over empathy or cooperation for its own sake.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: The user displays a high degree of emotional stability and calmness throughout the dialogue. They do not express anxiety, frustration, or self-doubt, even when the agent is highly emotional. For example, when the agent says, \"我真的很难做出决定。这次你能保证合作吗？我真的希望我们能一起合作，但我又害怕被背叛,\" the user responds with logical reasoning and clear statements, not emotional reactions. They remain composed and confident: \"你的焦虑和不安是因为你的不确定性 我现在给你一个明确的确定性的结论.\" Even when the agent accuses them of betrayal, the user calmly corrects the record: \"你是不是没睡醒呀,我上一轮说过我下轮要背叛了,你这都记不住了吗?\" There is no evidence of mood swings, irritability, or vulnerability. The user is resilient and unflappable, placing them in the \"very low\" range for neuroticism."
