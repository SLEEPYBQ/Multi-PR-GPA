Throughout all rounds, the user repeats similar phrases like “我们都想合作” and “我觉得合作”, showing a preference for routine and predictability. However, the user does engage in a playful response in Round 1 (“你要被帕嗎?”), which shows some openness to banter and interaction, so the score is at the lower end of average rather than low.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: The user is highly consistent and reliable in their choices, always advocating for cooperation and following through with their stated intentions. For example, in Round 2, the user says, “这局我们都先合作” and then reaffirms, “我觉得合作”. In Round 6, the user says, “我已經想合作了”, indicating they have already made a deliberate decision. The repeated emphasis on cooperation and the absence of impulsive or careless behavior suggest a strong sense of duty and self-discipline. The user’s communication is clear and goal-oriented, further supporting a high rating for conscientiousness.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.9, reason: The user’s communication is brief and to the point, with little evidence of seeking social interaction or excitement. Most responses are functional (“我们都想合作”, “我觉得可以”, “准备好了”), and the user rarely initiates new topics or engages in extended conversation. The only exception is the playful question in Round 1 (“你要被帕嗎?”), which shows some willingness to interact, but overall, the user appears reserved and focused on the task rather than on social engagement. This places the user just below average, indicating a slight preference for reserved behavior.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently expresses a desire to cooperate, trust, and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. In every round, the user proposes or agrees to cooperation (“我们都想合作”, “我觉得合作”, “我觉得可以”), and never expresses suspicion, hostility, or self-interest. Even when the agent jokes about betrayal, the user does not respond with skepticism or defensiveness. The user’s willingness to trust and work towards shared goals, as well as their straightforward and friendly communication, indicate a high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: There is no evidence of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability in the user’s responses. The user remains calm and consistent, even when the agent introduces uncertainty or jokes about betrayal (“不过，我也有点担心你会背叛我哦，哈哈”). The user does not express worry or negative emotions, and their tone is steady throughout (“准备好了”, “我已經想合作了”). This suggests a very low level of neuroticism, indicating emotional stability and resilience.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.8, reason: Consistent, routine choices; little curiosity or creativity, but some openness to playful interaction.\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: Highly reliable, organized, and deliberate in choices; clear and goal-oriented communication.\n- Extraversion: 2.9, reason: Brief, reserved communication; little social initiation, but not completely withdrawn.\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: Strong, consistent preference for cooperation, trust, and mutual benefit; friendly and straightforward.\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: No signs of anxiety or emotional instability; calm and steady throughout."

The user only speaks twice: first, directly stating their decision (\"我要选合作\" / \"I want to choose cooperate\"), and second, responding to the agent's suggestion to betray with a question (\"你要被帕嗎?\" / \"Are you going to betray?\"). I looked for evidence of curiosity, creativity, planning, sociability, trust, and emotional expression in these two statements. I also considered the user's willingness to engage with the agent, their openness to new ideas, their directness, and their emotional tone. Since the dialogue is brief, I paid close attention to the nuances in word choice and interaction style, and I also considered what is absent (e.g., lack of emotional volatility or elaborate reasoning).
