For example, “我也希望合作” is a polite, cooperative response, but not particularly expressive or energetic. The question “你要选什么?” is functional rather than socially engaging. The user does not seek attention or display enthusiasm, and the briefness of responses suggests a reserved or low-key interaction style. Therefore, the user scores low on extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 3.7, reason: The user consistently expresses a willingness to cooperate (“我也希望合作”) and seeks to align with the agent’s intentions (“你要选什么?”), indicating trust and a desire for mutual benefit. The tone is polite and non-confrontational, and there is no evidence of skepticism, stubbornness, or antagonism. The user’s responses support the agent’s suggestions and show a straightforward, compliant attitude. The user does not display strong altruism or empathy, but the overall approach is friendly and cooperative, supporting a high (but not very high) agreeableness rating.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: There is no evidence of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability in the user’s responses. The user remains calm and composed, even when faced with uncertainty (“你要选什么?”). The responses are emotionally neutral, and there are no signs of stress or mood fluctuation. The user does not express worry or vulnerability, suggesting a low level of neuroticism. However, the limited data means we cannot rule out all emotional fluctuation, so the score is low but not very low."
