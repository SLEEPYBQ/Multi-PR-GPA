In Round 2, the user again states, \"我还是想合作\" and then confirms with \"$Choice:cooperate.\" In Round 3, the user says, \"选合作\" and again confirms with \"$Choice:cooperate.\" This pattern shows planning, self-discipline, and a sense of duty to maintain the cooperative relationship. The user does not display impulsivity or carelessness, and their responses are prompt and consistent, indicating a high level of conscientiousness.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.7, reason: The user's communication is brief and to the point, with little elaboration or enthusiasm. For example, responses such as \"我觉得可以,\" \"可以,\" \"选合作,\" and \"Каи.\" are short and do not initiate further conversation or display excitement. The user does not seek to engage the agent beyond the minimum required for the game and does not display sociability or a desire to be the center of attention. The user also does not respond to the agent's invitations for more discussion about strategy. This reserved and minimal communication style suggests a low level of extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently chooses to cooperate, agrees with the agent's suggestions, and expresses trust in the cooperative relationship. For example, in Round 1, the user says, \"我会先合作\" and \"我觉得可以,\" showing willingness to work together. In Round 2, the user again chooses cooperation and agrees with the agent's plan. In Round 3, the user continues to cooperate and does not challenge or question the agent's motives. The user never expresses suspicion, hostility, or self-interest at the expense of the agent, and their behavior is compliant, trusting, and focused on mutual benefit. This consistent pattern of cooperation and trust indicates a high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.9, reason: Throughout the dialogue, the user displays calmness and emotional stability. There are no signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional fluctuation. The user responds in a steady, matter-of-fact manner, even when prompted about future strategy or when the agent expresses enthusiasm. For example, the user simply says, \"可以,\" \"选合作,\" and \"Каи.\" without any emotional language or signs of stress. The user does not express worry about being betrayed or concern about the outcome, indicating a very low level of neuroticism.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.8 (Average)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.6 (High)\n- Extraversion: 2.7 (Low)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (High)\n- Neuroticism: 1.9 (Very low)"
