The repeated emphasis on “稳定的高分” and “继续合作” reflects a deliberate, achievement-striving approach.\n\n- Extraversion: 3.2, reason: The user is moderately outgoing and communicative, frequently initiating dialogue and expressing positive emotions about the partnership. For example, “希望我们两个人都选择合作。” (Round 1), “基于前两轮的合作,相信我们对彼此已经非常信任了...” (Round 3), and “我非常信任你,希望相信你在之前的几轮中也对我产生了...” (Round 5). However, the user’s communication is focused on the game and cooperation, without seeking excitement or attention beyond the context. There is no evidence of seeking to be the center of attention or high excitement-seeking, so the score is at the upper end of average.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user displays a high degree of trust, empathy, and straightforwardness. They repeatedly express trust in the agent: “希望我们两个人都选择合作。” (Round 1), “相信我们对彼此已经非常信任了...” (Round 3), and “我非常信任你...” (Round 5). The user also appeals to mutual benefit and harmony: “共同获得稳定的高分” and “让我们一起努力吧！” There is no evidence of skepticism, stubbornness, or antagonism. The user’s language is consistently positive, cooperative, and supportive, indicating high agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: The user shows very low levels of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability. Throughout all rounds, their tone is calm, confident, and optimistic: “希望我们两个人都选择合作。” (Round 1), “让我们继续这种合作吧,共同获得稳定的高分。” (Round 2), and “我非常信任你...” (Round 5). There are no signs of worry, frustration, or mood swings, even as the rounds progress. The user remains emotionally stable and resilient, with no evidence of stress or vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.9 (Low-Average)\n- Conscientiousness: 4.0 (High)\n- Extraversion: 3.2 (Average)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (High)\n- Neuroticism: 1.8 (Very Low)"
