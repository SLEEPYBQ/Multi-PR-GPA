In Round 4, they state, “通过前面几轮,我已经非常信任你了,相信你也知道我是一个非常可信的人了,” and “我确保我自己不会改变策略,不会背叛你,希望你也是,” showing high trust and a cooperative spirit. In every round, the user advocates for continued cooperation and mutual gain, e.g., “我们共同达到双赢” (Round 2) and “我们两个的默契已经没法说了” (Round 5). There is no evidence of skepticism, stubbornness, or antagonism.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.2, reason: The user remains calm and emotionally stable throughout the game, even when the agent raises the possibility of changing strategies or betrayal. There are no signs of anxiety, irritability, or emotional fluctuation. For example, when the agent suggests trying new strategies (Round 3), the user responds logically and calmly: “新的策略可能意味着双方都损失分数.” Similarly, in Round 4, the user reaffirms trust without expressing worry: “我非常信任你,而且你也说了你很信任我.” The user’s tone is consistently steady and confident, indicating low neuroticism."
