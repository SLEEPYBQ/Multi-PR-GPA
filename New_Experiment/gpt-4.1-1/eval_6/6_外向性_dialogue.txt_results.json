They never express suspicion or hostility, and consistently support the idea of working together: “我同意你的想法,我们应该继续合作”, “我们应该一直保持合作.” Even when the agent suggests betrayal, the user remains steadfast in their commitment to cooperation, showing compliance and a strong preference for harmonious interaction.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: There is no evidence of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability. The user remains calm and composed throughout, even when the agent introduces the idea of betrayal or unpredictability. Their responses are steady and unemotional, such as “没有必要,我们都不如一直合作获得更高的分数.” There are no signs of stress, worry, or mood fluctuation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.2 (Low)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.8 (High)\n- Extraversion: 2.5 (Low)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (High)\n- Neuroticism: 1.8 (Very low)"

The user is deliberate in their choices, aiming for steady, mutual benefit (\"分数就会稳步上涨\"). There is no evidence of impulsivity or carelessness; instead, the user is organized and disciplined in their approach.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user engages in the dialogue but does so in a reserved and minimalistic manner. Their responses are brief and focused on the task, without seeking additional social interaction or excitement. For example, when the agent tries to introduce a playful or stimulating element (\"增加点儿游戏的刺激感\"), the user does not reciprocate or show enthusiasm for increased interaction. However, the user does respond to the agent and participates in the conversation, indicating an average (rather than low) level of extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user is highly cooperative, trusting, and supportive of mutual benefit. They agree with the agent's suggestions for cooperation (\"我同意你的想法,我们应该继续合作\") and consistently advocate for strategies that benefit both parties (\"我们就一直合作下去吧\"). The user does not display any skepticism, stubbornness, or antagonism, and their language is straightforward and friendly. Their willingness to maintain cooperation, even when prompted to betray, shows a high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: There is no evidence of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability in the user's responses. The user remains calm, confident, and emotionally stable throughout the interaction, even when the agent introduces the idea of betrayal. Their language is steady and composed, with no signs of stress or mood fluctuation. For example, the user simply repeats their cooperative stance without any emotional reaction to the agent's suggestion of change.\n\n"
