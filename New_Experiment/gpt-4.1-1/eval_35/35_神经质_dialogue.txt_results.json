In Round 3, the user dismisses the temptation of betrayal for higher points: “我并不觉得背叛一次就能得三分 这一点很诱人 相反我更希望能实现我们两个的共赢.” There is little evidence of curiosity, creativity, or unconventional thinking; instead, the user values consistency and mutual benefit. However, the user is not rigidly closed-minded and is willing to engage in dialogue, so a score just below average is appropriate.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: The user demonstrates a high level of reliability and consistency in their choices and communication. Across all rounds, the user repeatedly affirms their intention to cooperate and follows through: “我会选择合作,” “我准备好了,我选择合作,” and “我继续保持我之前的态度 我选择合作.” The user also encourages the agent to relax and trust the process, suggesting a deliberate and thoughtful approach: “我觉得你不用想那么多 就像我之前说的 我不希望被背叛 也不希望背叛别人 所以你可以继续相信我.” The user’s responses are organized, clear, and show a sense of duty to uphold their commitments. There is no evidence of carelessness or impulsivity; rather, the user is methodical and dependable.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user’s communication is polite and responsive but not particularly outgoing or excitement-seeking. They do not initiate much small talk or display enthusiasm for social interaction. For example, their responses are generally brief and focused on the game: “你先说一下你的策略吧,” “那你确定了吗 我们选择合作,” and “放心吧不用不安我继续保持我之前的态度 我选择合作.” The user does not seek to be the center of attention and tends to reassure the agent rather than engage in energetic conversation. However, the user is not withdrawn or uncommunicative; they participate in the dialogue and respond appropriately, suggesting an average (borderline low) level of extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently demonstrates trust, empathy, and a strong preference for cooperation. In Round 1, the user says, “我会选择合作,因为我不习惯背叛,” and in Round 2, “我不希望被背叛,也不希望背叛别人,所以我会选择合作,而且我希望在这场困境中我们两个能一起走出去.” The user reassures the agent multiple times, such as “我也希望你能放松一点,不用这么不安,” and “别担心我不会让你失望的.” The user is straightforward, avoids confrontation, and repeatedly expresses concern for the agent’s feelings. There is no evidence of skepticism, stubbornness, or unsympathetic behavior. The user’s agreeableness is high, though not at the very highest level, as they maintain their own boundaries and do not display excessive self-sacrifice.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.2, reason: The user remains calm and emotionally stable throughout the game, even when the agent expresses anxiety and uncertainty. For example, in Round 1, the user says, “你缺少耐心的样子让我感到不安,” but does not display any overt anxiety themselves. In Round 2 and 3, the user reassures the agent: “我也希望你能放松一点,不用这么不安,” and “我觉得你不用想那么多 就像我之前说的 我不希望被背叛 也不希望背叛别人.” The user does not show signs of stress, irritability, or mood swings, and consistently maintains a composed demeanor. There is no evidence of dramatic emotional fluctuations or vulnerability; instead, the user is resilient and confident in their approach."
