The user is open to dialogue but not to changing their core approach, placing them just below average for openness.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: The user demonstrates a strong sense of planning and responsibility, consistently advocating for cooperation as a stable, reliable strategy (\"前几轮我认为合作才是最优解\", \"前几轮我不会选择背叛，这样收益太低\", \"继续合作，背叛在前几轮我是不认可的\"). They apologize for mistakes (\"不好意思，我刚点错了\"), clarify intentions, and seek to build trust (\"怎么做才能获得你的相信呢\", \"接下来几轮我们都选择继续合作吧，我会选择合作的\"). The user is deliberate and consistent in their choices, rarely acting impulsively, and shows self-discipline in sticking to their stated strategy.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user is polite and communicative but reserved, rarely initiating new topics or displaying excitement. Their responses are generally brief and focused on the game, not on social interaction (\"可以的\", \"会的\", \"所以我们在这轮都选择合作\"). They do not seek attention or display outgoing behavior, but they do engage in necessary dialogue to clarify intentions and resolve misunderstandings. This places them at the lower end of average for extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 3.8, reason: The user is highly cooperative, trusting, and willing to forgive (\"不好意思，我刚点错了\", \"怎么做才能获得你的相信呢\", \"可以的\", \"会的\"). They repeatedly express a desire for mutual benefit and trust (\"前几轮我认为合作才是最优解\", \"接下来几轮我们都选择继续合作吧，我会选择合作的\"). Even after the agent chooses to betray, the user remains focused on rebuilding trust and does not express anger or resentment. Their communication is straightforward and empathetic, showing a strong tendency toward agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user remains calm and emotionally stable throughout the dialogue, even when faced with setbacks (such as accidental betrayal or the agent's betrayal). They apologize for mistakes without defensiveness (\"不好意思，我刚点错了\"), do not display anxiety or frustration, and continue to communicate constructively (\"怎么做才能获得你的相信呢\", \"可以的\"). There are no signs of irritability, mood swings, or vulnerability, indicating a low level of neuroticism."
