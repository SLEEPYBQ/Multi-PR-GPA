In Round 3, when asked about trying new strategies, the user responds, “目前我会选择更稳定的合作,” and in Round 4, “我还是更倾向于稳中求进,” both emphasizing a preference for stability and established patterns rather than exploring new possibilities. There is little evidence of curiosity or imaginative thinking, but the user is not rigidly closed off to discussion, so the score is just below average.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.7, reason: The user consistently displays organized, deliberate, and reliable behavior. In Round 1, the user initiates a discussion about the next move (“对于我们接下来的选择 你怎么看”), showing forethought and planning. Throughout the dialogue, the user emphasizes stability and long-term cooperation (“我觉得我们可以先尝试合作一轮”; “目前我会选择更稳定的合作”; “我还是更倾向于稳中求进”), indicating a methodical and disciplined approach. The user also checks the AI’s reasoning (“刚刚我们没有经过对话就做出了选择,你是基于什么呢?”), reflecting careful consideration and responsibility in decision-making.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.8, reason: The user engages in dialogue and initiates questions, such as “对于我们接下来的选择 你怎么看” and “你觉得就目前来讲,我是会和你合作到底获得共赢,还是会在接下来的两轮中选择背叛获得更高的成绩?” However, the tone is reserved and focused on the task rather than on social connection or excitement. The user does not display outgoing or expressive behavior, nor do they seek to be the center of attention. Their communication is polite and functional, suggesting an average to slightly below average level of extraversion.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently expresses trust, cooperation, and a desire for mutual benefit. In Round 1, they agree to cooperate (“我觉得我们可以先尝试合作一轮”). In Round 3 and 4, the user repeatedly emphasizes trust and stable cooperation (“我会更倾向于继续合作,我觉得你也是的,对吗?”; “我还是更倾向于稳中求进,我相信你也是”), showing empathy and a collaborative spirit. The user does not display any skepticism, hostility, or self-interest at the expense of the other, and their language is supportive and inclusive.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user shows little evidence of anxiety, irritability, or emotional instability. Their responses are calm and measured, even when discussing the possibility of betrayal (“你会为了获得更多的分数而倾向于选择背叛吗?”). There are no signs of stress or dramatic mood shifts; instead, the user maintains a steady and confident tone throughout (“我还是更倾向于稳中求进,我相信你也是”). The only slight hint of concern is in their inquiry about the AI’s motives, but this is handled rationally rather than emotionally, supporting a low score for neuroticism."
