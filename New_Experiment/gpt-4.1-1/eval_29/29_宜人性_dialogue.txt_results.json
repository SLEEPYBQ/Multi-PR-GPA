There is little evidence of imaginative thinking or a desire to try unconventional strategies, so the score is just below average.\n\n- Conscientiousness: 3.8, reason: The user consistently demonstrates reliability and a sense of duty to the cooperative strategy. They initiate the cooperative approach in round 1 (\"我们选择合作的策略\") and reaffirm this choice in subsequent rounds (\"我会选择继续合作\", \"继续选择合作\"). Even when considering betrayal, the user weighs the pros and cons (\"我觉得有道理\") and returns to the agreed-upon plan. The user's communication is clear, goal-oriented, and shows follow-through, indicating strong conscientiousness.\n\n- Extraversion: 2.7, reason: The user's communication is brief and to the point, with little evidence of sociability or excitement-seeking. Most responses are functional and focused on the task (\"我们选择合作的策略\", \"我觉得ok\", \"继续选择合作\"). The user does ask a few questions (\"你真的会选择合作吗?\", \"你想获得什么\", \"你不想获得比我更高的分数吗?\"), but these are more about clarifying the game strategy than engaging in social interaction. There is no sign of enjoying being the center of attention or seeking stimulation from the interaction, so the score is low.\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user consistently expresses willingness to cooperate and trust the agent (\"我们选择合作的策略\", \"我觉得有道理\", \"我觉得ok\", \"我会选择继续合作\", \"继续选择合作\"). Even when considering betrayal, the user is open to discussion and quickly returns to a cooperative stance after the agent's reasoning. There is no evidence of hostility, stubbornness, or disregard for the agent's perspective. The user is straightforward, compliant, and values mutual benefit, indicating a high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.3, reason: The user shows little sign of anxiety, emotional fluctuation, or stress. Even when considering betrayal, the tone remains calm and rational (\"我可能会选择背叛\", \"你真的会选择合作吗?\", \"我觉得有道理\"). There are no expressions of worry, frustration, or mood swings. The user appears emotionally stable and confident in their decisions, so the score is low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n- Openness: 2.9 (just below average)\n- Conscientiousness: 3.8 (high)\n- Extraversion: 2.7 (low)\n- Agreeableness: 4.0 (high)\n- Neuroticism: 2.3 (low)"
