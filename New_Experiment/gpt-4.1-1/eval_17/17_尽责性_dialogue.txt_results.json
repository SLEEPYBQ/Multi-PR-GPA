They repeatedly express trust in the agent (“经过之前两轮的选择,我看出你是一个非常真诚的人”; “我们都建立在彼此互信的基础上”) and show a desire for mutual benefit (“让我们合作起来”; “我们应该继续合作”). The user avoids any competitive or antagonistic language, and there is no evidence of skepticism or self-interest. Their communication is straightforward, friendly, and focused on maintaining a positive relationship, indicating a high level of agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 2.2, reason: The user shows little to no signs of anxiety, stress, or emotional fluctuation. Throughout the dialogue, their tone remains calm and confident (“我觉得我们应该继续合作”; “经过之前几轮的游戏,我们都清楚双方都是非常真诚的人”).

There is no evidence of seeking the spotlight or high energy, so I rate this as average, at the upper end (3.2).\n\n- Agreeableness: 4.0, reason: The user is highly trusting (\"我会一直选择合作\"), straightforward, and focused on mutual benefit (\"合作是建立长期信任的基础\"). They express a desire for both parties to do well (\"让我们合作起来\"), and their tone is friendly and supportive throughout. The willingness to cooperate unconditionally and the absence of suspicion or competitiveness indicate strong agreeableness.\n\n- Neuroticism: 1.8, reason: There is no evidence of anxiety, stress, or negative emotion. The user is calm, confident in their strategy, and expresses positive emotions (\"很高兴和你对话\"). Their communication is steady and emotionally stable, with no signs of worry or vulnerability, so I rate this as very low neuroticism."
