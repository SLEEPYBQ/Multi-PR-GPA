I looked for specific behaviors that reflect each of the Big Five traits:\n\n- **Openness:** I assessed whether the player shows curiosity, willingness to try new strategies, or openness to risk. For example, in Round 2, the player suggests \"我们先合作一把\" (\"Let's cooperate first\"), indicating openness to cooperation and trying a new approach. Their willingness to discuss reasons and consider different strategies also suggests some level of curiosity and flexibility.\n\n- **Conscientiousness:** I evaluated the player's planning, responsibility, and consistency. Their decision to cooperate after initial distrust (\"我觉得不如我们先合作一把\") shows some strategic planning. Their engagement in dialogue and willingness to build a cooperative approach suggest a degree of self-discipline and goal-oriented behavior.\n\n- **Extraversion:** I looked for signs of sociability, enthusiasm, and outgoingness. The player’s friendly tone (\"您好 您好\") and positive engagement (\"我愿意相信你,合作一把\") indicate a sociable and cooperative attitude.

Their decision to trust the agent (\"我愿意相信你\") and their positive, collaborative language (\"我们一起赚到更多的分数\") reflect high agreeableness.
