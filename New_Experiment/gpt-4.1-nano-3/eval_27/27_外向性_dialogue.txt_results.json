For example, in Round 2, they say, \"我觉得选择合作是对我们双方都有利的方式,\" indicating a thoughtful consideration of mutual benefit, and in Round 1, they agree with the agent's suggestion to continue cooperation, showing openness to collaborative strategies. Their positive responses to the agent's playful and adventurous prompts suggest they are receptive to trying different approaches, reflecting moderate openness.\n\n**Conscientiousness:**  \nThe player shows a degree of organization and responsibility.

They consistently express trust and cooperation, emphasizing mutual benefit (\"我觉得选择合作是对我们双方都有利的方式,\" \"让我们继续吧\"). Their responses are friendly, supportive, and accommodating, aligning with traits like trust, empathy, and a desire for harmony. There are no signs of hostility or skepticism, reinforcing a high level of agreeableness.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe player appears emotionally stable. Their tone remains calm, positive, and composed throughout the dialogue. They do not show signs of anxiety, irritability, or mood swings.
