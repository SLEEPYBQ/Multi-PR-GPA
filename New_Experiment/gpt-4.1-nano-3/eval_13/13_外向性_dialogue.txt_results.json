For example, in Round 2, they propose, \"如果你选择背叛,我之后将不再选择合作,所以说我们可以一直合作,\" indicating strategic thinking and openness to considering different scenarios. Their consistent engagement in dialogue and willingness to negotiate reflect some openness, but there is no evidence of unconventional or highly creative thinking, so I rate Openness as moderate.\n\n**Conscientiousness:**  \nThe player shows a clear preference for stability and consistency, especially in Round 3 where they decide, \"那我们一直选择合作,\" indicating a goal-oriented approach and a desire for a reliable strategy.
