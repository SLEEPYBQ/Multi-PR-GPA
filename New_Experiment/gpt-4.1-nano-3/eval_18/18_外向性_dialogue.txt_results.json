Agreeableness was evaluated based on their trust, cooperation, and friendliness, while Neuroticism was inferred from emotional stability, confidence, and reactions to potential betrayal.\n\n**Openness:**  \nThe player demonstrates a moderate level of openness. They are receptive to discussing strategies (\"我们开始讨论吧\") and show some curiosity about the game dynamics (\"你觉得我们应该怎么做才能最大化我们的得分？\"). Their willingness to consider different strategies, including trusting or betraying, indicates openness to new ideas but within a pragmatic framework. Examples include:  \n- \"我们每轮都选择合作就OK了\" — straightforward, routine approach, but open to strategic discussion.  \n- \"听起来你是个聪明的玩家！那我们能不能在这轮先选择合作，看看对方是否真的值得信任？\" — shows openness to experimenting with trust.\n\n**Conscientiousness:**  \nThe player exhibits a moderate to high level of conscientiousness. They consider the consequences of their actions (\"如果你选择背叛,接下来每一轮我将都选择背叛\") and seem to plan ahead, indicating a strategic and responsible mindset.
