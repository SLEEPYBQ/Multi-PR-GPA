Their plan to switch strategies in subsequent rounds (\"第二轮的时候需要你来选合作,我来选背叛\") indicates openness to trying different approaches and exploring the game dynamics. They also mention \"这是个有趣的提议\" (\"this is an interesting proposal\"), showing appreciation for novelty and strategic experimentation.\n\n**Conscientiousness:**  \nThe player shows some planning and responsibility, evident in their explicit strategy of testing trust and switching tactics based on previous cooperation (\"如果我们前期合作的好的话,后面就会得到高分\"). Their communication suggests they are deliberate in their approach, aiming for a long-term benefit rather than impulsive decisions. However, their language does not strongly emphasize organization or self-discipline, so their conscientiousness appears moderate.\n\n**Extraversion:**  \nThe dialogue is friendly and engaging, with the player initiating interaction (\"你好\", \"很高興看到你選擇了合作\").
