They say, \"我可以很明确的告诉你 我会选择合作,\" and \"我还是会选择合作,\" demonstrating straightforwardness and a desire to maintain harmony.

Their responses are forgiving and trusting, indicating a high level of agreeableness.\n\n**Neuroticism:**  \nThe player’s tone is calm, composed, and emotionally stable. They do not display signs of anxiety, hostility, or mood swings. For example, they calmly discuss testing trust and maintaining cooperation without expressing frustration or stress.
