For example:\n- **Openness**: I looked for signs of creativity, curiosity, or a willingness to try new strategies.\n- **Conscientiousness**: I assessed whether the player demonstrated organization, planning, or responsibility in their decisions.\n- **Extraversion**: I observed how socially engaged the player was during the dialogue and whether they sought interaction or preferred solitude.\n- **Agreeableness**: I evaluated the player’s level of cooperation, empathy, and trustworthiness.\n- **Neuroticism**: I checked for emotional stability or signs of stress, anxiety, or mood swings.\n\n### Player's Personality Traits Rating: \n\n- Openness: 2.3, reason: The player occasionally shows some strategic thinking, such as mentioning \"betrayal\" as a way to maximize personal gain (e.g., Round 2: \"This can make my gains maximized\").

Additionally, after observing the zero-sum outcome of mutual betrayal in Round 3, the player quickly shifts back to cooperation, indicating adaptability and self-discipline.

For example, their statements are functional and task-oriented rather than emotionally charged or excessively sociable. They rarely initiate extended discussions beyond the immediate context of the game, suggesting a balanced preference for both interaction and solitude.
